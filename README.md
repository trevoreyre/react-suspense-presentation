# React Suspense Presentation

This is the source code to my React Suspense presentation. It's a simple app that displays users and posts fetched from a dummy API, built with [`create-react-app`](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app).

It's separated into 3 folders:

- `app-initial` is the initial state of the application. Viewable at [react-suspense-demo-initial.trevoreyre.com](https://react-suspense-demo-initial.trevoreyre.com).
- `app-final` is the application after moving to React Suspense. Viewable at [react-suspense-demo.trevoreyre.com](https://react-suspense-demo.trevoreyre.com).
- `presentation` are the slides for the presentation, built with [Spectacle](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle). See the slides at [react-suspense.trevoreyre.com](https://react-suspense.trevoreyre.com).

## Running locally
